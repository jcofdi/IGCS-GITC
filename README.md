GITS-IGCS Camera Tools
------
__The tools are entirely built on the awesome Injectable Game Camera System created by Frans Bouma. I have not really modified the core functionality in any substantial way but I have added a number of additions and refinements. You can find his patreon with even more tools based upon a new camera system with enhanced features, check it out!__  

All tool binaries have been removed as tools are being transferred to my new GITC Camera Tools platform - all currently available tools can be explored from https://ghostinthecamera.co.uk/tools/.

### Requirements to build the code
To build the code, you need to have VC++ 2015 update 3 or higher, newer cameras need VC++ 2017. 
Additionally you need to have installed the Windows SDK, at least the windows 8 version. The VC++ installer should install this. 
The SDK is needed for DirectXMath.h

### External dependencies
There's an external dependency on [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) through a git submodule. This should be downloaded
automatically when you clone the repo. The camera uses DirectXMath for the 3D math, which is a self-contained .h file, from the Windows SDK.
